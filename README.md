# Mushroom Classification Using Different Classifiers
* Mushrooms are not just good to taste, but they have some medicinal properties as well. A research centre would like to explore the different types of mushrooms, to understand which of them are edible, and which are not, so that they could discover some of the hidden properties of mushrooms, which could possibly heal certain terminal illnesses.


# Problem Statement
**In this project, we will examine the data and create a machine learning algorithm that will detect if the mushroom is edible or poisonous by its specifications like cap shape, cap color, gill color, etc. using different classifiers.**



**Successfully build the model, and deployed on streamlit-cloud**
